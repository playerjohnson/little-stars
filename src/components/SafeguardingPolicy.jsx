        <h3>Our commitment</h3>
        <p>
          Little Stars Babysitting is committed to safeguarding and promoting the
          welfare of all children in our care. Every child deserves to feel safe,
          valued, and protected, and their wellbeing is always our highest priority.
        </p>

        <h3>DBS &amp; qualifications</h3>
        <p>
          Our babysitter holds an Enhanced DBS check and is enrolled on the DBS
          Update Service, meaning the check can be verified at any time. A current
          Paediatric First Aid certificate is also held. Parents and guardians are
          welcome to request verification of these credentials before any booking.
        </p>

        <h3>Safe care practices</h3>
        <p>
          During every session, we follow these principles to keep children safe:
        </p>
        <p>
          We always supervise children appropriately for their age. We never use
          physical punishment or any form of restraint. We follow any care
          instructions, routines, and boundaries set by the parent or guardian.
          We do not administer prescription medication unless specifically agreed
          in writing beforehand. We ensure the environment is safe and any hazards
          are managed before activities begin.
        </p>

        <h3>Communication with parents</h3>
        <p>
          At least one parent or legal guardian must be contactable by phone for
          the entire duration of every session. We will contact you immediately
          if there is any accident, injury, or concern during a session. For
          non-urgent matters, we will update you when you return home.
        </p>

        <h3>Emergency procedures</h3>
        <p>
          In the event of a medical emergency, we will call 999 immediately and
          administer first aid as appropriate. The parent or guardian will be
          contacted straight away. If a child is collected by someone other than
          the parent, this must be agreed in advance with the name of the
          collecting adult provided beforehand.
        </p>

        <h3>Reporting concerns</h3>
        <p>
          If at any time we have concerns about a child's safety or welfare,
          we have a duty to act. This may include speaking to the parent or
          guardian, or in serious cases, contacting the relevant local authority
          children's services or the police. This duty overrides any obligation
          of confidentiality.
        </p>
        <p>
          We follow the guidance set out in the government's "Working Together
          to Safeguard Children" framework. If you have any concerns about
          a child's welfare, you can contact the NSPCC helpline on
          0808 800 5000 or Childline on 0800 1111.
        </p>

        <h3>Online safety</h3>
        <p>
          We will not allow children to access inappropriate content on any
          devices during a session. If screen time is part of the agreed
          routine, we will ensure only age-appropriate content is used and
          will follow any rules set by the parent or guardian.
        </p>

        <h3>Photography &amp; social media</h3>
        <p>
          We will never photograph or record children during a session, or share
          any images or information about children on social media, without the
          explicit written consent of the parent or guardian.
        </p>

        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>
          This policy is reviewed regularly and updated as needed. If you have
          any questions or concerns about our safeguarding practices, please
          contact us via WhatsApp or through the details provided in your
          booking confirmation.
