          a bid through this website, you confirm that you have read, understood, and
          agree to be bound by these Terms.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Definitions</h3>

          <br />

          the babysitting service.
          <br />
          <strong>"Bid"</strong> refers to a booking request submitted through the
          website, including the proposed hourly rate.
          <br />
          <strong>"Booking"</strong> refers to a confirmed arrangement where a Bid
          has been accepted by the Service Provider.
          <br />
          <strong>"Service"</strong> refers to in-home childcare provided by the

        </p>

        <h3>2. Service Description</h3>
        <p>
          Little Stars provides in-home babysitting services for children. All
          sessions take place at the Client's home address. The Service includes
          supervising children, engaging them in age-appropriate activities (crafts,
          games, stories, outdoor play), and ensuring their safety and wellbeing
          during the booked period.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Service does not include: overnight stays, transportation of children,
          the administration of prescription medication (unless specifically agreed
          in writing beforehand), or care at the Service Provider's home.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Bidding &amp; Contract Formation</h3>
        <p>
          The website operates a bidding system. Submitting a Bid constitutes an
          <strong> offer</strong> by the Client to engage the Service Provider at
          the proposed hourly rate for the specified date and time.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Bid does not guarantee a Booking. The Service Provider reserves the
          right to accept, decline, or not respond to any Bid at their sole
          discretion.
        </p>
        <p>
          A binding contract is formed only when the Service Provider explicitly
          accepts a Bid, at which point the Bid status changes to "Confirmed."
          The confirmed hourly rate is the rate stated in the accepted Bid.
        </p>
        <p>
          The minimum bid amount is displayed on the website for each available
          slot. Bids below the stated minimum will not be accepted. Where multiple
          Bids exist for the same slot, higher bids are more likely to be accepted,
          but the Service Provider is not obligated to accept the highest bid.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Payment</h3>
        <p>
          Payment is due at the end of each babysitting session unless otherwise
          agreed. The total fee is calculated as the confirmed hourly rate multiplied
          by the duration of the session.
        </p>
        <p>
          Payment methods accepted will be communicated upon confirmation of the
          Booking. If a referral code has been applied and validated, the agreed
          discount percentage will be applied to the total fee.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Cancellation Policy</h3>
        <p>
          The following cancellation charges apply to confirmed Bookings. These
          charges represent a genuine pre-estimate of the Service Provider's loss,
          as accepted Bookings may result in the Service Provider declining other
          work for the same period.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>More than 24 hours' notice:</strong> No charge.
          <br />
          <strong>12–24 hours' notice:</strong> 50% of the total booking value.
          <br />
          <strong>Less than 12 hours' notice or no-show:</strong> 100% of the
          total booking value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cancellation notice is calculated from the time the cancellation is
          received by the Service Provider to the start time of the Booking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bids that have not yet been accepted ("Pending" status) may be withdrawn
          at any time without charge.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Service Provider needs to cancel a confirmed Booking, the Client
          will not be charged and will receive as much notice as possible.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Client Responsibilities</h3>

        <p>
          The Service Provider will exercise reasonable care in looking after the
          Client's child(ren). However, the Service Provider's total liability
          for any claim arising from or in connection with the Service is limited
          to the total fee paid for the Booking in question.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits liability for death or
          personal injury caused by negligence, fraud or fraudulent
          misrepresentation, or any other liability that cannot be excluded or
          limited by law (Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, s.2(1)).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Service Provider is not liable for loss or damage to the Client's
          property unless caused by the Service Provider's negligence.
        </p>

        <h3>9. Force Majeure</h3>
        <p>
          Neither party shall be liable for any failure to perform their
          obligations where such failure results from circumstances beyond their
          reasonable control, including but not limited to severe weather, illness,
          family emergency, travel disruption, or public health restrictions.
          In such cases, neither party shall be charged a cancellation fee.
        </p>

        <h3>10. Safeguarding</h3>
        <p>
          The Service Provider is committed to the safety and wellbeing of all
          children in their care. If the Service Provider has any concerns about
          a child's welfare, they are duty-bound to follow safeguarding procedures,
          which may include contacting the relevant authorities. This obligation
          overrides any duty of confidentiality.
        </p>

        <p>
          Personal data provided through the booking process is handled in
          accordance with the Privacy Policy, which can be found on this website.
          The legal basis for processing booking data is the performance of a
          contract (UK GDPR, Article 6(1)(b)). The legal basis for analytics
          cookies is consent (Article 6(1)(a)).
        </p>

        <h3>12. Reviews &amp; Testimonials</h3>
        <p>

        <p>
          In the event of a dispute, both parties agree to attempt to resolve
          the matter informally in the first instance. If the dispute cannot be
          resolved informally, either party may pursue resolution through the
          courts of England and Wales. These Terms are governed by the laws of
          England and Wales.
